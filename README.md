You Have to create blogs/portofolios in strapi by yourself. I created the content types for you. \
If you don't start the strapi backend , The blog and the Portofolio page will return "loading..."  but everything else will work as intended\
You can delete my implementation on those pages and implement your own Pages.

## Install Node Modules
cd frontend\
npm install\
cd backend\
npm install


## Run The app As I did on Youtube
Go to frontend folder and type "npm run start" for the react-app\
Then go to the backend folder and type "npm run develop" for the strapi backend\
STRAPI EMAIL/PASSWORD : test@test.com / Test12345 (http://localhost:1337) 

## Available Scripts (React frontend)
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

## Available Scripts (Strapi backend)
### `npm run strapi develop`
Open http://localhost:1337 to view it in your browser.\
### `npm run strapi start`
### `npm run strapi build`
